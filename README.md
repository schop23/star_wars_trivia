Trivia from a Galaxy Far, Far Away...

# Star Wars Triva

## Description
This is a 10 questions, multiple choice, trivia game that is focused on the the Star Wars films, episodes I - VII. This trivia game tests your knowledge of the Star Wars films and provides you four options to choose your answer from.  At the end of the game it will tell you the number of questions you got right out of 10. This game is for one player or a group of people trying to figure out the answer to the questions.

## Brief Example 
This is a screen shot of the game in the Chrome browser:

## List of Features
This game in its current state is in the Bronze category. Each question is on its own page and at the end there is functionality to tally the number of correct answers out of 10.  I would like to, in the future, add a reset button and animation for question transition that mimics the word crawl in the opening sequence of every Star Wars movie.

## List of Technologies
This project has separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Installation Instructions
This game can be opened in your browser by going to the website: https://schop23.github.io/star_wars_trivia/
